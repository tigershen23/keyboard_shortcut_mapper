# Human

- [x] TEST OUT PLAYWRITER BEFORE DOING THESE THO. Claude Desktop/Cowork, OpenCode, and CC
- [x] Look into https://github.com/diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase and https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code
- [ ] Figure out syncing [AGENTS.md](https://AGENTS.md) and [CLAUDE.md](https://CLAUDE.md) and stuff (do a research thing)
- [x] Opencode kimi!!! Read opencode docs, review dotfiles changes. Use it to build the a11y stuff.
- [x] kimi: remove dead code
- [x] Try sprites.dev for dev

w/ Claude though:

The current task is XYZ. You are being given a subset of this task.

Finished a bunch of the 13_keyboard_ui_2.md task.

- Top Left opt/cmd/etc
- Globe key
- Shorten all the rows: tilde is normal sized, adjust accordingly by making the right side keys same size. Also the backslash key is normal sized
- Bit more space on number keys
- Closer opacity between 1 and !
- More padding for English labels
- Overall background
- Size of arrows
- Move #s to layer switcher
- Add accessibility labels everywhere!

- [ ] After UI looks good back to meta, here and above:

**Meta**

- [x] Workflow: new spec (global shortcut) that makes specs/… , then !writespec and !runspec in agents. `spec today` for a new daily todos thing
- [ ] CSS theming with styled-components: KIMI
- [ ] Get oxfmt oxlint working. Compare with bun biome etc. Integrate with editor, should be 0 problems in the codebase!!

GET CLAUDE CODE TO AUTORUN LINT AND FORMAT ON SAVE, START WITH ACTIONBAR.TSX MANUALLY THEN DO THE REST OF THE CODEBASE. SHOULD BE AN HOUR OR SO TO CLEAN IT ALL UP??

- [ ] Get tsgo working
- [x] Figure out playwriter do some toy dev server task

- [ ] Come up with a deslop Claude command
- [ ] Check and eval codebase against: https://factory.ai/news/agent-readiness
- [ ] Update Custom instructions everywhere: never ever have a preamble!!! Here you go: "this is ready to...", Claude Code, raycast, chat, Claude
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Review code, learn anything I don't know including CSS (maybe anki)
- [ ] Set up mise with test, typecheck, and lint/format, have it run pre-commit, maybe with husky. oxlint-tsgolint and whatnot. Try doing this with claude code.
- [ ] Set up basic but comprehensive full playwright test (w/ bun). use the a11y labels. First ask claude for recommendations on testing the repo
