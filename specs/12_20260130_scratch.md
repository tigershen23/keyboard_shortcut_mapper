# Human

- [x] TEST OUT PLAYWRITER BEFORE DOING THESE THO. Claude Desktop/Cowork, OpenCode, and CC
- [x] Look into https://github.com/diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase and https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code
- [ ] Figure out syncing [AGENTS.md](https://AGENTS.md) and [CLAUDE.md](https://CLAUDE.md) and stuff (do a research thing)
- [x] Opencode kimi!!! Read opencode docs, review dotfiles changes. Use it to build the a11y stuff.
- [x] kimi: remove dead code
- [x] Try sprites.dev for dev

w/ Claude though:

The current task is XYZ. You are being given a subset of this task.

Finished a bunch of the 13_keyboard_ui_2.md task.

- Top Left opt/cmd/etc
- Globe key
- Shorten all the rows: tilde is normal sized, adjust accordingly by making the right side keys same size. Also the backslash key is normal sized
- Bit more space on number keys
- Closer opacity between 1 and !
- More padding for English labels
- Overall background
- Size of arrows
- Move #s to layer switcher
- Add accessibility labels everywhere!

- [ ] After UI looks good back to meta, here and above:

**Meta**

- [x] Workflow: new spec (global shortcut) that makes specs/… , then !writespec and !runspec in agents. `spec today` for a new daily todos thing
- [x] CSS theming with styled-components: KIMI
- [x] Get tsgo working
- [x] Figure out playwriter do some toy dev server task
- [x] Get oxfmt oxlint working. Compare with bun biome etc. Integrate with editor, should be 0 problems in the codebase!!

COMING BACK AFTER BREAK:

- START WITH ACTIONBAR.TSX MANUALLY THEN DO THE REST OF THE CODEBASE
- MAKE SURE BUN COMMANDS CAN RUN WITH FILES PASSED IN
- GET CLAUDE CODE TO AUTORUN LINT AND FORMAT ON SAVE,

- [x] Set up mise with test, typecheck, and lint/format, have it run pre-commit, maybe with husky. oxlint-tsgolint and whatnot. Try doing this with claude code.
- [x] Check and eval codebase against: https://factory.ai/news/agent-readiness
- [x] Set up basic but comprehensive full playwright test (w/ bun). use the a11y labels. First ask claude for recommendations on testing the repo
- [x] Update Custom instructions everywhere: never ever have a preamble!!! Here you go: "this is ready to...", Claude Code, raycast, chat, Claude
- [ ] Come up with a deslop Claude command run it on all files, one at a time
- [ ] Review code, learn anything I don't know including CSS (have a side ankify list)
