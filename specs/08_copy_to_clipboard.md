Things are looking up. Let's figure out the best place now to add "Copy to Clipboard" functionality. Can you review the current UI @src/frontend.tsx and, using your frontend skill, propose the best UX for this? Maybe plan ahead a little bit to where there could be multiple "actions" like this in the UI in the future.

The functionality for Copy to Clipboard should be to, as markdown, copy the mappings in this format:

## Hyper

[Going row by row in the keyboard, only including keys with mappings]
Q: Ghostty (action name not app name)
W: Figma
...etc

## Command

[same format as hyper]
